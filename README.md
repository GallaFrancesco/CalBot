## CalBot 

A simple bot which I use to keep track of my appointments. It alerts me at defined hours of the day about the present and following day's dues.

# Usage

Depends on:
* **python-telegram-bot**
* **schedule**

All the other modules are found in the standard Python library.

Define your CalCurses timetable, then run it with:

```
python3 calbot.py
```
